- a contains number, b is empty
- not duplicated
- sort numbers in stack a

the allowed moves:
	sa: swap 2 first elements at the top of stack a
	sb: swap 2 first elements at the top of stack b
	ss: do sa and sb at the same time
	pa: put first element of at the top of b and put it at the top of a
	pb: put first element of at the top of a and put it at the top of b
	ra: shift all elements of stack a by 1
	rb: shift all elements of stack b by 1
	rr: do ra and rb
	rra: reverse ra
	rrb: reverse rb
	rrr: rra and rrb at the same time


* create sorted array of  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7...

- sort numbers (with index)
- check meme functions
- rotate up
- reverse rotate down

- method for 3 numbers
- method for 5 numbers
- method for 100 numbers
- method for 500 numbers


- in push A to B:
	copy first elemnt of A
	rotate A up
	rotate B down
	put copyed number at the top of B
	decrease A->lenght by 1
	increase B->lenght by 1

x < 3 -> 3 moves
5	<= x <=    8 ->	   12 moves
100	<= x <=  700 ->	 1100 moves
500	<= x <= 5500 -> 11500 moves


saad:
	x <= 10  ->	5
	x <= 150 -> 8
	x >	 150 ->	15
