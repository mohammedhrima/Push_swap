- a contains number, b is empty
- not duplicated
- sort numbers in stack a

the allowed moves:
	sa: swap 2 first elements at the top of stack a
	sb: swap 2 first elements at the top of stack b
	ss: do sa and sb at the same time
	pa: put first element of at the top of b and put it at the top of a
	pb: put first element of at the top of a and put it at the top of b
	ra: shift all elements of stack a by 1
	rb: shift all elements of stack b by 1
	rr: do ra and rb
	rra: reverse ra
	rrb: reverse rb
	rrr: rra and rrb at the same time
